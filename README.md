# Background of the Enterprise

Kepak is one of Ireland's leading meat producers, with 15 manufacturing facilities in Ireland   and the UK. Known for its meat craft, quality and outstanding customer service; Kepak is grounded in nature and dedicated to animal welfare. In addition, innovation and inspirational nutrition drives its business forward (About Kepak, 2019). 

Kepak was founded by Noel Keating in 1966 as a family-owned, future-oriented butcher shop. Since then, Kepak has grown significantly, maintaining the trust of its suppliers and customers by producing great products and quality meats. Since its founding on Francis Street in Dublin, Kepak has grown into an international food innovator offering a variety of product (History Kepak, 2019).

Across 43 countries, Kepak employs over 5,000 people to deliver prime cuts of fresh meat, successful brands, and innovative food products. The Kepak Group produces a wide range of products for retail and foodservice markets and strives to offer high quality. Some of its products include Rustlers, Big Al’s, John Stone, Celtic Beef, Gold star and McIntosh Donald. Others are Hereford, Black Angus, Angus Butcher, Spice Burger, and Deli Delicious amongst others (About Kepak, 2019). 

# Current IT Setup

Information Technology infrastructure refers to everything needed to deliver IT services within an organization, including hardware, software, and network resources.  IT infrastructure can be used internally within an organization, or externally, to deliver services or resources to its customers. A company's IT infrastructure serves as a means to drive efficiency and value creation through the use of technology, whether it is to enable software developers to follow their specific development methodology or to enable other types of organizations to leverage technology. An organization's IT infrastructure provides the structure needed to effectively manage all its technology and tools (Khan, 2017). 

From research conducted, Kepak outsources some of its IT solutions to Chilli but does not seem to have a substantial investment in cloud technologies ref. They also have much of their IT infrastructure located on-premise. Kepak’s IT Infrastructure include the following; Hardware, Software and Networking components. Some of these infrastructures include Data centers, routers, computers, network hubs, software components amongst others. From research and findings as earlier outlined, all of these IT infrastructures for Kepak are largely located on-premise which showcases a huge opportunity to plug into the numerous advantages of deploying cloud technologies to the company.

# Recommendations

One of the main goals of this report is to outline the advantages Kepak can gain from the vast opportunities that abound within the cloud space. For example Gartner says more than 45% of IT spending on system infrastructure, application software, infrastructure software, and business process outsourcing will shift to the cloud by 2024 ref. Similarly, in a survey conducted by Sujay Vailshery on Statista in 2020; among 2020 respondents, 48 percent cited increased efficiency as the biggest advantage of cloud computing (Gartner_Inc). 

# Contrast of Cloud vs. Non Cloud Solutions

Non-cloud Solutions often referred to as On-premise refers to a situation where the company owns the complete hardware configuration and the software setup it uses. Cloud solutions, on the other hand, is a subscription-based service solution that provides networked storage and computing resources from a third party like Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure Service amongst others. 
With respect to service level deployment, there are three types that can be found in a cloud service; they are Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS). The concept of Infrastructure as a Service refers to organizations receiving hardware, storage, networking, and other services without having to manage or maintain them for example Amazon. Platform as a Service refers to a service where consumers can deploy applications that are created or acquired using programming languages, libraries, tools, and services that the provider supports onto the cloud infrastructure while Software as a service is a service where applications are hosted and made available through the internet by a cloud provider (Khan, 2017). 

As a fast moving consumer goods industry, I would recommend Software as a service model for Kepak’s IT infrastructure that involves web servers for their website. I would recommend Infrastructure as a service model for their Hardware, Storage and Networking components; while Platform as a service is recommended for the software IT infrastructure components used daily by Kepak.

# Recommendations: Justification

SaaS Deployment for Webservers: Kepak produce fast moving consumer goods, producing more than 3000 burgers in one hour. As a result, it is essential there is limited or no downtime with their webservers. They also have peak periods like in December where they have much more demand; it would be more economical to upscale on the cloud rather than having to physically add and remove additional requirements. Using this model can also help then reduce latency as they expand to go global from its current base in UK and Ireland. They can deploy their web servers within different availability zones at very minimal cost.

IaaS Deployment for Hardware Components: One of the major advantage of cloud computing is its economy of scale. Kepak can reduce cost by deploying Infrastructure as a Service for its hardware and networking components. They can use infrastructure as the need arise rather. In addition, I believe there would be a reduced cost in managing its data center than outsourcing the management of on-premise IT infrastructure.

PaaS Deployment for Software Components: There are various software applications that Kepak uses for the daily running of its business which are critical to its success. Most of these applications are hosted on-premise which can result in data loss; however deploying same to the cloud will help to curb this.
